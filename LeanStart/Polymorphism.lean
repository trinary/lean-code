/- Write a function to find the last entry in a list. It should return an Option. -/
def last {Î± : Type} (xs : List Î±): Option Î± :=
  match xs with
  | [] => Option.none
  | y :: [] => y
  | _ :: ys => last ys

#eval last [] (Î± := Nat)
#eval last [1,2,3]
#eval last [1]

/- Write a function that finds the first entry in a list that satisfies a given predicate-/

def List.findFirst? {Î± : Type} (xs : List Î± ) (predicate : Î± -> Bool) : Option Î± :=
  match xs with
  | [] => Option.none
  | y :: ys => if predicate y then y else findFirst? ys predicate

#eval [1,2,3].findFirst? (Â· % 2 == 0)

/- Write a function Prod.swap that swaps the two fields in a pair. -/
def Prod.swap {Î± Î² : Type} (pair : Î± Ã— Î²) : Î² Ã— Î± := {fst := pair.snd, snd := pair.fst }
#eval ("foo", 2).swap

/- Rewrite the PetName example to use a custom datatype -/
inductive PetName where
  | dogName : String â†’ PetName
  | catName : String â†’ PetName
deriving Repr

def animals : List PetName := [PetName.dogName "dog1", PetName.catName "cat1", PetName.dogName "dog2"]

def countDogs (pets : List PetName) : Nat :=
  match pets with
  | [] => 0
  | PetName.dogName _ :: morePets => 1 + countDogs morePets
  | PetName.catName _ :: morePets => countDogs morePets

#eval countDogs animals

#check List (Nat Ã— Nat)

/- Write a function zip that combines two lists into a list of pairs. -/
def zip {Î± Î² : Type} (as : List Î±) (bs : List Î² ) : List (Î± Ã— Î²) :=
  match as, bs with
  | [], _ => []
  | _, [] => []
  | a :: moreAs, b :: moreBs => (a, b) :: zip moreAs moreBs

#eval zip [1, 2, 3] ["one", "two", "three"]
#eval zip [2,1] ["two", "one", "three"]

/- Write a polymorphic function take that returns the first n entries in a list, where n is a Nat. -/
def take {Î± : Type} (num : Nat) (as : List Î±) : List Î± :=
  match as, num with
  | a :: as, Nat.succ s => a :: take s as
  | _, _ => []

#eval take 3 ["bolete", "oyster"]

/- Using the analogy between types and arithmetic, write a function that distributes products over sums.
ðŸ˜± the fn type is Î± Ã— (Î² âŠ• Î³) â†’ (Î± Ã— Î²) âŠ• (Î± Ã— Î³)
Î± Ã— Î² is a product type, where each value is an Î± and a Î² together
Î± âŠ• Î² is a sum type, a single value of either type Î± or type Î²
so we end up with *either* an Î± and Î² OR an Î± and Î³ as product elements in a sum. Makes sense!
I don't know how to express that the resulting type from (x.fst, x.snd) IS ALREADY the sum type we want though :(
having reasoned through it this seems axiomatic, how do I write it?
Just (x.fst, x.snd) doesn't infer the sum-of-products type we want -/

def distribute {Î± Î² Î³ : Type} (x : Î± Ã— (Î² âŠ• Î³)) : (Î± Ã— Î²) âŠ• (Î± Ã— Î³) :=
  match x.snd with
  | Sum.inl b => Sum.inl (x.fst, b)
  | Sum.inr g => Sum.inr (x.fst, g)
/- I AM STARTING TO UNDERSTAND -/

/- Using the analogy between types and arithmetic, write a function that turns multiplication by two into a sum. -/
/- type: Bool Ã— Î± â†’ Î± âŠ• Î± -/
/- ðŸ˜¥ maybe similar issue to the previous exercise, I am not sure of the syntax I need to express this -/
def double { Î± : Type } (x : (Bool Ã— Î±)) : (Î± âŠ• Î±) :=
  if x.fst then Sum.inl x.snd else Sum.inr x.snd
